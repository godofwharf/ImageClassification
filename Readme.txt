Please check the writeup for dependencies
I haven't attached Opencv with the submission since it's too big (around 300 mb)
I am posting links for downloading the library files since i experienced failures when i tried to upload large zip files
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
All the necessary libraries can be downloaded from the link mentioned above
Make sure the paths to the files are correct before you run the program
